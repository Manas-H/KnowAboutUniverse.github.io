               <h2>1. Neutron stars can spin at a rate of 600 rotations per second</h2>
               <img src="Photos/neutron.jpg">
               <p>Neutron stars are one of the possible evolutionary end-points of high mass stars. They're born in a core-collapse supernova star explosion and subsequently rotate extremely rapidly as a consequence of their physics. Neutron stars can rotate up to 60 times per second after born. Under special circumstances, this rate can increase to more than 600 times per second.</p>

                <h2>2. There is an uncountable number of stars in the known universe</h2>
                <img src="Photos/spacefacts/starsss.jpg">
                <p>We basically have no idea how many stars there are in the universe. Right now we use our estimate of how many stars there are in our own galaxy, the Milky Way. We then multiply that number by the best guesstimate of the number of galaxies in the universe. After all that math, NASA can only confidently say that say there all zillions of uncountable stars. A zillion is any uncountable amount.<br><br>

                    An Australian National University study put their estimate at 70 sextillion. Put another way, that's 70,000 million million million.</p>

            <h2>3. Jupiter's Red Spot is shrinking</h2>
            <img src="Photos/spacefacts/spot.jpg">
            <p>Jupiter's famous Red Spot has been shrinking over the past few decades. This spot on the planet is  a giant spinning storm that used to be able to fit about three Earths. Now, according to only one Earth can fit inside the spot.<br><br>

                Interestingly enough, as the storm is shrinking in width, it's actually growing taller in length. As of 2018, scientists are still stumped as to why this phenomenon is occurring in the first place, but some theorize that it may have to do with jet streams on Jupiter that have either changed direction or location.</p>

            <h2>4.  95% of the Universe is invisible</h2>
            <img src="Photos/spacefacts/uni.webp">
            <p>There is a discovery so amazing that it has yet to trickle into the consciousness of most working scientists: everything science has been studying these past 350 years is but a minor contaminant of the Universe.<br><br>

                Only about 4.9% of the mass-energy of the Universe is atoms: the kind of stuff you, me, the stars and galaxies are made of (and, of that, only half has been spotted with telescopes).<br><br>
                
                About 26.8% of cosmic mass-energy is invisible dark matter, revealed because it tugs with its gravity on the visible stuff.<br><br>
                
                Candidates for what makes up dark matter include hitherto unknown subatomic particles and black holes made in the Big Bang.<br><br>
                
                But, in addition to dark matter there is dark energy, accounting for 68.3% of the mass-energy of the Universe.<br><br>
                
                It’s invisible, fills all of space and is accelerating cosmic expansion. And our best theory – quantum theory – overestimates its energy density by a factor of one followed by 120 zeroes!<br></p>

            <h2>5.  The first gravitational waves detected came from a binary black hole system nobody predicted</h2>
            <img src="Photos/spacefacts/bh.webp">
            <p>On 14 September 2015, gravitational waves were detected on Earth for the first time. These ripples in the fabric of space-time – predicted by Einstein in 1916 – came from the merger of two black holes in a distant galaxy.<br><br>

                Briefly, the power pumped out was 50 times greater than that of all the stars in the Universe combined. But this was not the only jaw-dropping aspect of the event.<br><br>
                
                Each of the black holes was in the 30 solar mass range. Since a black hole is what’s left after most of a star has blown into space as a supernova, the precursor stars must have weighed at least 300 solar masses.<br><br>
                
                Such stars are incredibly rare today. But the two black holes could have been remnants of the very first generation of stars – thought to be huge – or even primordial black holes, born in the inferno of the Big Bang itself.<br><br></p>
